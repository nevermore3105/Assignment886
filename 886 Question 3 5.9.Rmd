#5.9
We want to graduate the mortality rate by standard table $q_x^o= n + mq_x^S$
Our job is to estimate parameters m and n. Again, the relationship between $\hat{q}$ and $q_x^S$
```{r}

x<-c(47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67)
Ex<-c(166,187,218,243,276,302,347,390,430,494,558,628,701,813,917,1040,1182,1299,1432,1596,1752)
dx<-c(2,2,4,6,2,4,7,3,9,9,8,11,14,18,18,24,30,43,41,54,64)
qSx<-c(0.00505,0.0057,0.00644,0.00728,0.00826,0.0093,0.01051,0.01184,0.01331,0.01492,0.01668,0.01859,0.02065,0.02287,0.02525,0.02778,0.03049,0.03339,0.03648,0.03978,0.04332)
crude3<-dx/Ex

LM3<-lm(crude3~qSx)
as.numeric(LM3$coefficients[2])

estn<-as.numeric(LM3$coefficients[1])
estm<-as.numeric(LM3$coefficients[2])
esta
estb
iv3=c(estn,estm)
```
Then we can obtain MLE estimates using nlm function.
```{r}
f3<-function(z){sum((Ex*(crude3-z[1]-z[2]*qSx)^2))}
a3<-nlm(f3,iv3)
a3
n<-a3$estimate[[1]]
m<-a3$estimate[[2]]
n
m
grad3<-n+m*qSx
grad3
plot(x,crude3,ylim=c(0.005,0.05),xlim=c(45,70))
lines(x,grad3,col="blue")  
```

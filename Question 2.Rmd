Question 2
a)
Without the offset account taken into consideration, Scott's repayment amount should be the same as that of Bill since both of them take in a loan of equal amount, and on the same term.
The annual repayment from Scott is $32,622.8

b)
Given annual payment amount, now with an addition payment made from the offset account, we can calculate the number of year taken for Scott to extinguish his loan. 
```{r}
pmt=32622.8
f2<-function(n){(pmt+100000*0.035)*(1-v^n)/i+100000*(1+i)^-n-600000}
uni2<-uniroot(f2,interval=c(0,30))
uni2
Q2<-ceiling(uni2[[1]])

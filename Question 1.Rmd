**Question 1**
\(pmt = Loan~outstanding/\frac{1-v^n}{i}  \: \)
```{r}
i=0.035
v=(1+i)^(-1)
annuity=(1-v^30)/i
f1<-function(pmt){pmt*annuity-600000}
uni1<-uniroot(f1,interval=c(0,100000))
```
```{r}
Q1<-uni1$root[[1]]
Q1
```
Given the interest rate of 3.5%, we are able to calculate the annuity factor of Bill's payments.
Following the discounted cashflow approach, the annual repayment from Bill is $32,622.8
